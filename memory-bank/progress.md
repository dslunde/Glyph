- **Python Startup Delay**: Initial Python import has noticeable latency
  - **Cause**: Large dependency loading (transformers, torch, etc.)
  - **Mitigation**: Lazy loading, background initialization planned

- **Memory Monitoring**: No current tracking of RAM usage during processing
  - **Risk**: Could exceed 10GB limit with large graphs
  - **Priority**: Critical for Phase 1 completion

### Architectural Debt
