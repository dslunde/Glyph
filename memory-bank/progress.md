#### ‚úÖ Critical Debugging & Production Fixes (Latest Session)

**Status File Lifecycle Management**:
- **Problem**: Stale status files from previous runs caused progress bar to jump instantly to 100%
- **Root Cause**: Swift was reading old `kg_status.json` files before Python created new ones
- **Solution**: Complete status file lifecycle management
  - Clear old status files before starting Python execution
  - Clean up status files after completion (success or error)
  - Proper file existence checking and error handling

**Timing Race Condition Resolution**:
- **Problem**: Swift polling started after Python completed, missing all progress updates
- **Root Cause**: Python execution was so fast that status polling was cancelled before it could start
- **Solution**: Reordered execution to start polling BEFORE Python execution
  - Status polling task created and started first (100ms head start)
  - Python execution begins after polling is active
  - Graceful cancellation with final status check

**Real-Time Progress Updates**:
- **Validation**: Progress updates now work seamlessly through all 5 phases:
  - 10% - Extracting concepts and entities (per-source granular updates)
  - 30% - Building initial graph structure  
  - 50% - Calculating centrality metrics
  - 70% - Finding minimal subgraph (MST algorithm with detailed logging)
  - 85% - Generating node embeddings
  - 100% - Knowledge graph construction complete
- **User Experience**: Smooth incremental progress bar with step-by-step messages

**Python ‚Üî Swift Data Conversion Fix**:
- **Critical Bug**: Minimal subgraph data was being lost in conversion (showing 0 nodes instead of 44)
- **Root Cause**: `convertPythonToSwift()` function converting complex data structures to strings
- **Solution**: Implemented proper recursive conversion with type detection:
  - Python lists ‚Üí Swift Arrays (with recursive element conversion)
  - Python dictionaries ‚Üí Swift Dictionaries (with recursive value conversion)  
  - Python None ‚Üí Swift NSNull()
  - Preserved all data types including nested structures
- **Result**: Minimal subgraph now properly contains 44 nodes and 75 edges as generated

**Production Validation**:

## üé® **KNOWLEDGE GRAPH CANVAS - FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

### Phase 7: Canvas Debugging & User Experience Enhancement  
**Status**: Critical Canvas rendering bugs completely resolved - Knowledge Graph Canvas now fully operational

#### ‚úÖ **Critical Bug Resolution Session**

**Session Objective**: Diagnose and fix knowledge graph canvas rendering issues preventing node/edge visibility
**Outcome**: Complete success - all Canvas functionality now working perfectly with enhanced user controls

#### ‚úÖ **Core Canvas Rendering Fix**
- **Critical Issue**: Nodes and edges invisible despite processing (357 nodes drawn but 0 visible)
- **Root Cause Analysis**: `clipToLayer(opacity: 1)` block preventing Canvas content rendering
- **Technical Solution**: Removed `clipToLayer` block, applied transformations directly to GraphicsContext
- **Validation**: All 357 nodes and 619 edges now render correctly with full visibility
- **Impact**: Transformed non-functional canvas into fully working graph visualization

#### ‚úÖ **Edge Visibility Enhancement**  
- **Problem**: Edges invisible in dark mode (user environment)
- **Analysis**: `Color.secondary.opacity(0.6)` too faint, insufficient line width
- **Solution**: Changed to `Color.white.opacity(0.9)` with increased thickness `max(1.5, 2.0 + edge.weight)`
- **User Validation**: Edges now clearly visible with proper scaling and dark mode compatibility
- **Performance**: 619 edges render smoothly with dynamic thickness based on relationship weight

#### ‚úÖ **Node Spacing Control Logic Overhaul**
- **Bug**: Spacing control cumulative, only increasing spread regardless of setting
- **Root Cause**: `applyNodeSpacing()` function applied to already-modified positions
- **Architecture Fix**: Implemented `originalNodePositions: [UUID: CGPoint]` storage system
- **Algorithm**: Store initial positions, apply spacing multiplication from original coordinates
- **Result**: Bidirectional spacing control (<1.0x brings nodes closer, >1.0x spreads apart)
- **User Experience**: Intuitive spacing control with immediate visual feedback

#### ‚úÖ **Pan Gesture Auto-Reset Resolution**
- **Issue**: Panning auto-reset to previous position when starting new drag gesture
- **Technical Cause**: `panOffset = value.translation` replacing existing offset instead of accumulating
- **Solution**: Added `initialPanOffset` state for proper gesture state management
- **Implementation**: Accumulate translations: `CGSize(width: initial.width + translation.width, ...)`
- **Result**: Smooth, continuous panning without unwanted position resets

#### ‚úÖ **Enhanced User Control Suite**
- **Node Size Range**: Extended from 20-80px to **10-80px** for finer granularity
- **Default Node Spacing**: Improved from 1.0x to **1.5x** for better initial layout spread
- **Spacing Range Extension**: From 0.5-3.0x to **0.5-5.0x** for maximum layout flexibility
- **User Experience**: All controls provide immediate visual feedback with smooth transitions

#### ‚úÖ **Canvas Architecture Excellence**

**Coordinate System Unification**:
- **Center Translation**: `context.translateBy(x: size.width/2, y: size.height/2)` for proper centering
- **Pan Application**: Accumulated drag offsets with state preservation between gestures
- **Zoom Integration**: `context.scaleBy(x: zoomScale, y: zoomScale)` with bounds (0.1x - 5.0x)
- **Consistency**: Unified coordinate system between drawing logic and interaction overlay

**State Management Architecture**:
- **Original Position Preservation**: `originalNodePositions` dictionary maintains initial layout state
- **Dynamic Spacing**: Real-time multiplication from stored original positions (not cumulative)
- **Project Isolation**: Complete state reset when switching between projects
- **Memory Efficiency**: Proper cleanup and resource management

**Data Flow Integration**:
- **Environment Object Pattern**: Views use `@EnvironmentObject` for live project updates
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Canvas reflects Python-generated graph data immediately  
- **Cross-Project Integrity**: No state contamination between different projects
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallbacks when graph data unavailable

#### ‚úÖ **User Experience Excellence**

**Visual Polish & Interaction**:
- **Node Types**: Color-coded nodes with intuitive type-based styling
- **Selection States**: Visual feedback for selected, dragged, and hovered nodes
- **Interactive Overlay**: Precise hit detection with enlarged interaction areas
