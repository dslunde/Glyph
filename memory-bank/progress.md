- **State Management**: @StateObject and @EnvironmentObject provide clean data flow

### Process Insights
- **PRD Compliance**: Clear requirements made implementation straightforward
- **Incremental UI**: Building UI before backend enables rapid iteration
- **User-Centered Design**: Tabbed interface matches user expectations for this type of app

### Architecture Insights
- **Hybrid Approach**: Swift UI + Python AI continues to work well

- **Local-First**: Simplified architecture, better privacy, immediate responsiveness

## Ready for Next Development Phase

**Current Status**: PRD UI requirements fully implemented and working
**Next Logical Step**: Harden authentication system and enhance learning plan persistence
**Timeline**: 2 weeks to production-ready authentication and learning plan features
**Success Metric**: Users can securely create accounts, edit learning plans with auto-save, and export to PDF

The foundation is solid and the UI matches the PRD specification exactly. Time to focus on making the authentication production-ready and the learning plan editor more robust before moving to real document processing.
