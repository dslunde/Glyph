# Product Context: Glyph - Why It Exists and How It Works

## Why Glyph Exists

### The Research Problem
Modern knowledge work faces a fundamental challenge: **information abundance without insight synthesis**. Researchers, students, and professionals spend 70% of their time finding and organizing information, leaving only 30% for actual thinking and discovery.

### Specific Pain Points
1. **Fragmented Knowledge**: Information exists in silos across papers, books, articles, and documents
2. **Invisible Connections**: Relationships between concepts are implicit and easily missed
3. **Bias Blindness**: Single-perspective research creates knowledge bubbles
4. **Scaling Challenges**: Manual synthesis breaks down with large source collections
5. **Learning Inefficiency**: No systematic way to go from novice to expert understanding

### The Vision
Glyph transforms research from a **linear, manual process** into an **intelligent, visual exploration**. Instead of reading sources sequentially, users can:
- See the entire knowledge landscape at once
- Discover unexpected connections between ideas
- Identify what's missing or contradictory
- Follow optimized learning paths

## How Glyph Works

### User Journey
1. **Topic Definition**: User specifies research topic, depth preference, and sensitivity level
2. **Source Collection**: Add documents, URLs, or folders of materials
3. **Intelligent Analysis**: AI processes sources to extract concepts and relationships
4. **Knowledge Graph Generation**: Visual network shows how ideas connect
5. **Insight Discovery**: System highlights gaps, contradictions, and uncommon perspectives
6. **Learning Plan Creation**: Structured curriculum with timeline and resources
7. **Export and Iteration**: Save projects, export outputs, refine over time
