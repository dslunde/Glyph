- **Validation Logic**: Name + at least one source preference required
- **Mock Data Integration**: Creates Spider-Man knowledge graph (10 nodes, 12 edges) and Lorem Ipsum learning plan

#### âœ… Tabbed Project Interface (PRD Section 2.2.1)
- **Learning Plan Tab**: Rich text editor with view/edit modes
- **Knowledge Graph Tab**: Interactive SwiftUI canvas with zoom, pan, drag functionality
- **Tab Navigation**: Clean TabView interface matching PRD specification

#### âœ… Learning Plan View (PRD Requirement)
- **Rich Text Editor**: TextEditor for markdown-style content editing
- **Markdown Rendering**: Custom SwiftUI markdown parser for headers, lists, numbered items
- **Lorem Ipsum Content**: Pre-populated with structured learning plan content as requested
- **Edit/View Toggle**: Switch between editing and formatted viewing modes

- **Graph Statistics**: Real-time node/edge counts and debug information
- **Progress Indicators**: Ready for real-time analysis feedback

#### âœ… Mock Data (PRD Specification)
- **Spider-Man Knowledge Graph**: 10 interconnected nodes covering characters, concepts, locations, documents
- **12 Relationship Edges**: Meaningful connections like "possesses", "teaches", "fights", "lives_in"
- **Lorem Ipsum Learning Plan**: Structured multi-phase learning content with objectives and resources
- **Proper Node Positioning**: All nodes positioned with positive coordinates for visibility

### ðŸŽ¯ Previous Accomplishments (Earlier Sessions)
- âœ… Technical Foundation: Swift + Python integration, build system, dependencies
- âœ… Core Data Models: Project, GraphNode, GraphEdge, comprehensive enums
- âœ… Graph Visualization: Canvas-based rendering with interaction capabilities
- âœ… Project Management: CRUD operations, persistence, sample data generation

## Current Focus Areas

### ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Sessions)

#### 1. Backend Integration Testing
**Status**: Ready to Begin
**Goal**: Connect UI flow to actual document processing
**Key Components**:
- Test authentication flow with multiple users
- Validate project creation with different configurations
- Ensure graph data persistence across sessions
- Test learning plan editing and saving

#### 2. Source Collection Interface
**Status**: Not Started (Next Phase)
**Goal**: Implement file picker and document input as specified in PRD
**Key Components**:
- File/folder path inputs (adjustable number)
- URL input fields for web sources
- Source metadata and validation
- Integration with existing project configuration

#### 3. Real Graph Generation
**Status**: Architecture Ready
**Goal**: Replace mock Spider-Man data with actual analysis
**Key Components**:
- Document parsing integration
- NLP-based concept extraction
- Real knowledge graph construction
- Progress indicators during processing

### ï¿½ï¿½ Active Development Decisions

#### Authentication Architecture
**Current Implementation**: Simple local storage with base64 password hashing
**Production Considerations**: 
- Replace with proper cryptographic hashing (bcrypt/scrypt)
- Consider Keychain integration for credential storage
- Add proper salt and pepper for password security
- Implement session refresh tokens

#### Learning Plan Persistence
**Current Status**: Learning plan changes are not saved to project
**Immediate Need**: Connect TextEditor changes to project updates
**Implementation**: Add save mechanism to LearningPlanView

#### Data Flow Integration
**Current Pattern**: 
```
UI Components â†’ ViewModels â†’ Mock Data
```
**Target Pattern**: 
```
UI Components â†’ ViewModels â†’ ProjectManager â†’ PythonGraphService â†’ Real Analysis
```

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### ðŸ”§ Authentication System
1. **Security**: Basic base64 encoding instead of proper password hashing
2. **Session Management**: No automatic refresh of expired sessions
3. **Multi-User**: No user-specific project filtering implemented yet
4. **Error Handling**: Basic error messages, need more specific feedback

### ðŸ”§ Learning Plan Editor
1. **Persistence**: Changes not saved to project automatically
2. **Markdown Support**: Basic rendering, missing features like links, images, tables
3. **Undo/Redo**: No text editing history management
4. **Export**: No PDF or formatted export capability

### ðŸ”§ UI Polish Needed
1. **Loading States**: Need spinners during project creation
2. **Empty States**: Better guidance when no projects exist
3. **Responsiveness**: Test with different window sizes
4. **Accessibility**: VoiceOver and keyboard navigation support
