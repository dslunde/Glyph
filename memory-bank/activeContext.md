## Current Focus Areas

### üéØ Recently Completed (This Session)

#### ‚úÖ PRD Sidebar and New Project Flow Implementation
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Achievement**: Full implementation of PRD-specified UI requirements
**Key Components Delivered**:
- Enhanced New Project Flow with all PRD fields (Topic, Depth, Source Preferences, Hypotheses, Controversial Aspects, Sensitivity Level)
- Interactive Knowledge Graph canvas with zoom, pan, and drag functionality
- Node editing capabilities (click nodes for details, edit properties, delete nodes)
- Enhanced sidebar with rich project information display
- Real-time progress indicators for graph generation
- Project information modal with complete configuration details

### üéØ Immediate Priorities (Next 2-3 Sessions)

#### 1. Source Collection Interface
**Status**: Not Started
**Goal**: User interface for adding and managing sources
**Key Components**:
- File picker for documents and folders
- URL input for web sources (offline mode preparation)
- Source metadata display and tagging
- Progress tracking during source processing

#### 2. Knowledge Graph Generation Engine
**Status**: Partially Started (UI Ready)
**Goal**: Implement core graph creation from source documents
**Key Components**:
- Document parsing (PDF, text files, folders)
- NLP-based concept extraction using transformers
- Relationship identification between concepts
- Graph construction with NetworkX backend

#### 3. Enhanced Graph Analysis
**Status**: Basic Implementation
**Goal**: Advanced graph analysis and insights
**Key Components**:
- Centrality calculations
- Community detection
- Knowledge gap identification
- Contradiction detection between sources

### üîÑ Active Development Decisions

#### Graph Visualization Strategy
**Decision Needed**: Choose between native SwiftUI drawing vs. embedded visualization
**Options**:
1. Pure SwiftUI with custom drawing (better integration, more work)
2. Web view with D3.js or similar (faster to implement, less native)
3. Hybrid approach with SwiftUI overlay on core visualization

**Recommendation**: Start with SwiftUI Canvas for MVP, optimize later

#### Data Flow Architecture
**Current Pattern**: 
```
User Input ‚Üí ViewModel ‚Üí PythonGraphService ‚Üí NetworkX ‚Üí Results
```
**Next Enhancement**: Add progress callbacks and cancellation support

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### üîß Technical Improvements Needed
1. **Error Handling**: More robust Python exception handling in PythonGraphService
2. **Memory Management**: Implement graph size warnings and memory monitoring
3. **Progress Feedback**: Add real-time progress indicators for long operations
4. **Testing**: Need comprehensive test suite for graph algorithms
5. **Performance**: Profile memory usage with large graphs

### üêõ Known Limitations
- **Dock Icon**: Swift Package Manager apps have limited dock integration (workaround: use Xcode build)
- **File Access**: May need broader file system permissions for document processing
- **Python Startup**: Initial Python import has noticeable delay (optimization opportunity)
