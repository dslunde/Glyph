#### 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

**1. AIInsightsView - Main Container**
- **Tab Navigation**: Clean TabView with four distinct sections
- **State Management**: Comprehensive state handling for analysis flow
- **Window Sizing**: Fixed frame constraints (800x600 minimum) to prevent dynamic resizing
- **Progress Integration**: Seamless progress tracking during analysis generation

**2. AnalysisReportView - Detailed Report Display**
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Navigate between analysis sections
- **Rich Content Display**: Formatted insights with priority indicators
- **Export Functionality**: Export analysis reports to files
- **Scrollable Content**: Proper scroll handling for long reports

**3. AnalysisReport Models - Data Structures**
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Swift models with proper typing
- **Nested Structures**: Complex data models for varied insight types
- **Codable Conformance**: Proper JSON serialization for persistence
- **Validation**: Built-in validation for data integrity

**4. advanced_analysis.py - Python Analysis Engine**
- **NetworkX Integration**: Advanced graph analysis algorithms
- **Centrality Measures**: Degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Community detection using Louvain method
- **LLM Enhancement**: Optional OpenAI integration for insight generation
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Knowledge gap detection, counterintuitive insight discovery

#### 🐛 **Critical Issues Resolved**

**1. Window Sizing and Popup Positioning**
- **Problem**: Dynamic window resizing caused popups to appear off-screen
- **Root Cause**: AIInsightsView didn't have frame constraints, causing size changes
- **Solution**: Added fixed frame constraints `.frame(minWidth: 800, maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 600, maxHeight: .infinity)`
- **Result**: Consistent window sizing preventing popup positioning issues

**2. Missing Python Module in Build**
- **Problem**: `advanced_analysis.py` module missing during runtime, causing fallback to mock analysis
- **Root Cause**: Module not included in build script's custom Python files list
- **Solution**: Added `"Sources/Glyph/advanced_analysis.py"` to `CUSTOM_PYTHON_FILES` array in `build_app.sh`
- **Result**: All 5 Python modules now successfully installed and accessible

**3. Type Annotation Error**
- **Problem**: `llm_available` variable had incorrect type annotation causing linter errors
- **Root Cause**: `openai_api_key.strip()` returns string, creating `str | Literal[False]` type instead of `bool`
- **Solution**: Changed to `bool(openai_api_key.strip())` ensuring boolean type
- **Result**: Clean type annotations with no linter errors

#### 📊 **Advanced Analysis Capabilities**

**Graph Analysis Features**:
- **Centrality Analysis**: Identify key nodes using multiple centrality measures
- **Community Detection**: Discover clusters and related concept groups
- **Knowledge Gap Detection**: Identify missing connections and underexplored areas
- **Counterintuitive Insights**: Discover unexpected relationships and contradictions
- **Uncommon Insights**: Find rare but potentially valuable connections

**LLM Integration**:
- **Optional Enhancement**: Uses OpenAI API when available for deeper insights
- **Fallback Strategy**: Comprehensive analysis using graph metrics when LLM unavailable
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient prompt engineering to minimize token usage
