# Glyph üåü
*Curious. Focused. Insightful. Minimal. Intelligent. Empowering.*

## What is Glyph?

Glyph is a native macOS desktop application that transforms how you approach research and learning. It automatically creates **knowledge graphs** and **personalized learning plans** from your research topics, helping you discover connections, identify gaps, and uncover insights that would take hours to find manually.

Think of it as your **intelligent research companion** that reads through sources, maps out relationships between concepts, and creates a visual roadmap for mastering any subject.

## Why Glyph Exists

Research today is overwhelming. Whether you're a student, researcher, or professional learner, you face:

- **Information Overload**: Thousands of sources, papers, and articles to sift through
- **Hidden Connections**: Important relationships between concepts that aren't obvious
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Areas you don't know you don't know
- **Bias Blindness**: Missing perspectives and contradictory viewpoints
- **Learning Inefficiency**: No clear path from novice to expert understanding

Glyph solves these problems by **automatically analyzing sources**, **mapping knowledge relationships**, and **creating structured learning paths** tailored to your goals.

## Key Features

### üß† **Intelligent Knowledge Graphs**
- **Automatic Concept Extraction**: Uses advanced NLP to identify key concepts, entities, and relationships from your sources
- **Visual Network Mapping**: Interactive SwiftUI canvas showing how ideas connect and influence each other
- **Scale Performance**: Handles graphs from 1K to 1M nodes with optimized algorithms
- **Core Concept Identification**: Automatically highlights the most important ideas using centrality analysis

### üìö **Smart Source Analysis**
- **Multi-Format Support**: Process PDFs, text files, URLs, and entire folders
- **Source Diversity Analysis**: Identifies bias by analyzing publication types and author backgrounds  
- **Contradiction Detection**: Finds conflicting claims across sources using NLP
- **Perspective Scoring**: Measures uniqueness and identifies insider vs. outsider viewpoints

### üó∫Ô∏è **Personalized Learning Plans**
- **Adaptive Depth**: Choose from Quick, Moderate, or Comprehensive learning approaches
- **Structured Curriculum**: Auto-generated study timeline with key concepts and recommended readings
- **Knowledge Gap Identification**: Highlights underexplored areas for deeper investigation
- **Practical Applications**: Connects theory to real-world use cases

### üîç **Research Intelligence**
- **Counterintuitive Truths**: Surfaces surprising contradictions and paradoxes
- **Uncommon Insights**: Discovers niche perspectives and overlooked connections
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Evaluates your assumptions against evidence
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Adapts to controversial or sensitive topics

### üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy & Offline Mode**
- **Local Processing**: All analysis happens on your Mac - no data sent to external servers
- **Offline Capable**: Process pre-saved files without internet connection
- **Encrypted Storage**: Projects secured with SQLCipher encryption
- **User Authentication**: Personal project management with secure access control

## How It Works

1. **Define Your Topic**: Enter your research question, hypotheses, and sensitivity preferences
2. **Gather Sources**: Add PDFs, documents, URLs, or point to folders of materials
3. **AI Analysis**: Glyph processes sources using Python 3.13.3 + advanced NLP models
4. **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Concepts and relationships are mapped into interactive visualizations
5. **Learning Plan Generation**: Receive a structured curriculum with study timeline and resources
6. **Explore & Refine**: Navigate the knowledge graph, edit connections, and customize outputs
